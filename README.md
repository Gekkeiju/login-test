PART II

Using Ruby on Rails, implement a simple login page which includes validation and saving to the
database. This does not need to be completely functional but just to show how you would
implement your code. Database will just be a sample or existing library you are using.

Can be run normally with `rails server` after cloning repo

Alternatively can be run with Docker `docker run -dp 3000:3000 lorenheim/login-test`
